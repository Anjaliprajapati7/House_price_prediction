# Real Estate Price Prediction Website

This repository contains a data science project series that guides you through the step-by-step process of building a real estate price prediction website. 

## Overview

1. **Model Building with sklearn**: We start by building a predictive model using the Bangalore home prices dataset obtained from Kaggle. The model is constructed using linear regression from sklearn.


## Data Science Concepts Covered

Throughout this project, we cover a wide range of data science concepts, including:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature engineering
- Dimensionality reduction
- Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV
- K-fold cross-validation

## Technologies and Tools Used

This project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- Python
- Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Sklearn for model building
- Jupyter Notebook
